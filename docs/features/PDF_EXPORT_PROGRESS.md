# PDF Export Progress Indicator

## Overview
Enhanced PDF export with real-time progress tracking showing which page is currently being processed.

## Features

### Progress Display
- **Page Counter**: Shows "Processing page X of N..."
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates as each page is captured
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress text below spinner
- **Smooth Transitions**: 50ms delay ensures text updates are visible

### Export Overlay

#### Layout
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│      [Spinner]      │
│                     │
│  Exporting PDF...   │
│                     │
│ Processing page     │
│    3 of 12...       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

#### Styling
- Dark backdrop with blur effect
- White spinner with rotation animation
- Large title text (24px, bold)
- Smaller progress text (16px, semi-transparent)
- Centered layout with proper spacing

## Implementation

### Progress Tracking
```javascript
const updateProgress = (current, total) => {
  progress.textContent = `Processing page ${current} of ${total}...`
}

// In export loop
for (let i = 0; i < pageElements.length; i++) {
  updateProgress(i + 1, pageElements.length)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50))
  // ... capture page
}
```

### Visual Elements
```javascript
// Progress text element
const progress = document.createElement('div')
progress.style.cssText = `
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 500;
  text-align: center;
`
```

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement
```
[Spinner]
Exporting PDF...
```
- No indication of progress
- User doesn't know how long to wait
- Unclear if process is stuck

### After Enhancement
```
[Spinner]
Exporting PDF...
Processing page 5 of 12...
```
- Clear progress indication
- User knows current status
- Can estimate remaining time
- Confidence that process is working

## Technical Details

### Timing
- **50ms delay** between pages ensures text updates are visible
- Minimal impact on total export time
- Allows browser to repaint progress text

### DOM Updates
- Progress text updated synchronously
- Delay allows DOM to render changes
- Overlay remains visible throughout process

### Error Handling
- Progress resets if export fails
- Overlay removed on completion or error
- No lingering UI elements

## Performance Impact

### Export Time Increase
- **Per Page**: +50ms delay
- **10 Pages**: +500ms (0.5 seconds)
- **50 Pages**: +2.5 seconds
- **Negligible** compared to html2canvas rendering time

### Benefits vs Cost
- **Cost**: Minimal time increase (< 5% of total)
- **Benefit**: Significantly better UX
- **Trade-off**: Worth it for user confidence

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
- `src/utils/pdfExport.js`
  - Added progress text element
  - Added `updateProgress()` helper
  - Added 50ms delay in export loop
  - Updated overlay structure

### Lines Changed
- +15 lines (progress element, helper function, delay)
