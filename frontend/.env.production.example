# Railway Instructions
# ======================
# Frontend and backend are now served from the same deployment:
# - Backend API: https://your-domain.up.railway.app/
# - Frontend App: https://your-domain.up.railway.app/zino
#
# 1. Deploy backend service
# 2. Copy Railway URL (Settings → Networking → Generate Domain)
# 3. Leave VITE_API_URL empty (uses relative paths) or set to Railway URL
# 4. Build frontend: npm run build
# 5. Backend serves frontend/dist from /zino path
# 6. Update Google OAuth redirect URI to: https://your-domain.up.railway.app/zino/auth/callback
# 7. Update CORS_ORIGIN to include: https://your-domain.up.railway.app
